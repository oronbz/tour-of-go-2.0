In addition to generic functions, Go also supports generic types. A type can
be parameterized with a type parameter, which could be useful for implementing
generic data structures.

This example demonstrates a simple type declaration for a singly-linked list
holding any type of value.

As an exercise, add some functionality to this list implementation.
