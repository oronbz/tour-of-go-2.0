It is common to append new elements to a slice, and so Go provides a built-in
`append` function. The [documentation](/pkg/builtin/#append)
of the built-in package describes `append`.

```go
func append(s []T, vs ...T) []T
```

The first parameter `s` of `append` is a slice of type `T`, and the rest are
`T` values to append to the slice.

The resulting value of `append` is a slice containing all the elements of the
original slice plus the provided values.

If the backing array of `s` is too small to fit all the given values a bigger
array will be allocated. The returned slice will point to the newly allocated
array.

(To learn more about slices, read the [Slices: usage and internals](/blog/go-slices-usage-and-internals) article.)
