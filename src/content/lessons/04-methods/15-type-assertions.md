A _type_assertion_ provides access to an interface value's underlying concrete value.

```go
t := i.(T)
```

This statement asserts that the interface value `i` holds the concrete type `T`
and assigns the underlying `T` value to the variable `t`.

If `i` does not hold a `T`, the statement will trigger a panic.

To _test_ whether an interface value holds a specific type,
a type assertion can return two values: the underlying value
and a boolean value that reports whether the assertion succeeded.

```go
t, ok := i.(T)
```

If `i` holds a `T`, then `t` will be the underlying value and `ok` will be true.

If not, `ok` will be false and `t` will be the zero value of type `T`,
and no panic occurs.

Note the similarity between this syntax and that of reading from a map.
